Ever wanted to know if it was statistically worth it to flip the [Card of Omens](http://www.wowhead.com/item=113355/card-of-omens) or the [Mysterious Fortune Card](http://www.wowhead.com/item=60838/mysterious-fortune-card)?  Have you ever flipped a bunch of cards and wondered how much gold you had tallied?

This will track all of that!  It will track the amount of each card denomination that is gained, as well as total value, and avg. per card.

This will track for both of the special Scribe cards. GOOD LUCK!
