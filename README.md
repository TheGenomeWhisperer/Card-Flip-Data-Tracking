# CARD FLIPPING

Ever wanted to know if it was statistically worth it to flip the [Card of Omens](http://www.wowhead.com/item=113355/card-of-omens) or the [Mysterious Fortune Card](http://www.wowhead.com/item=60838/mysterious-fortune-card)?  Have you ever flipped a bunch of cards and wondered how much gold you had tallied?

This will track all of that!  It will track the amount of each card denomination that is gained, as well as total value, and avg. per card.

## ADDITIONALLY

The data collected from me personally has been exported to Excel, and after **140k flips** (As of Oct 2nd publishing), the following data can has been collected.

[HERE IS A LINK TO THE LIVE SPREADSHEET](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AnkdXSikaKozjrkr9rL6EIAEmgoWMQ)

**CARD OF OMENS**

**140,000 Cards = 703,729.225g Value** = **5.027g per card Avg.**

**WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT CARD AVG IN 1000 FLIPS?**

*Using the Distribution Data*

**Probability of getting 15g or *MORE* per card on Avg.** = 0.12%

**Probability of getting 10g or *MORE* per card on Avg.** = 6.57%

**Probability of getting 7.5g or *MORE* per card on Avg.** = 22.65%

And on the flip side

**Probability of getting 2.5g or *LESS* per card on Avg.** = 22.17%
